          Hi! My name is Okeke Nkechi, founder of Mechus. There are two master problems Mechus wants to solve:

          Problem 1: The problem of a tech owner.
          Problem 2: The problem of a tech engineer. <br><br><br>

          Acquiring a gadget is easy. Managing the gadget is somewhere in the middle. Repairing the  is difficult.  
          Do you have a pile of laptops ðŸ’», phones ðŸ“±, and wristwatches âŒš that has been lying dormant in your home ?
          Have you ever gone through sweat and blood to fix your laptop, phone, or wristwatch?
          Do you have a spoilt car that has been lying in your garage for years?
          Ever got stuck on the highway for 2 hours before you get a mechanic?
          What about those other gadgets that litter your home, feeling they are impossible to repair due to their sophistication? <br><br><br>

          We want to repair your tech. We want to alleviate the stress you face in repairing them. Donâ€™t stress any more. Sit in your couch, grab a soft drink, pick up your phone, and order for a Mechus engineer that will attend to you in minutes.( It is that simple.) We try our best to go diverse; meaning we fix virtually any tech (apart from aeroplanes obviously) ðŸ¤£. <br>   
          Visit our website or download our application to get started.
